A experimental project for making QEMU lightweight based on Dune and KVM
Inspired by Dune and KVM, I'd like to implement a prototype tool that functions as qemu without mmu emulation and i/o device driver. In order to make it more cool, I'd like to use some of main technologies that Dune is based on.
